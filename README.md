# Mall Customer Segmentation — Data Science Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to analyze mall customer data and segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to discover meaningful patterns that can support targeted marketing and business strategy decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore and clean customer dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns in customer behavior
- Apply clustering algorithms for segmentation
- Visualize and interpret customer groups

## 🧠 Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and scaling
- K-Means clustering
- Elbow and Silhouette methods for optimal number of clusters
- Data visualization

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Outputs
- Customer clusters based on income and spending patterns
- Visual cluster plots
- Segment interpretation and insights
- Model evaluation using clustering metrics
